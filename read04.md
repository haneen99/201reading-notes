# HTML Links - Hyperlinks
HTML links are hyperlinks.

You can click on a link and jump to another document.

When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.
## HTML Links - Syntax
The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:

<a href="url">link text</a>
The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>
