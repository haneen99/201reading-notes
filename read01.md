## what is html

* HTML pages are text documents. 
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled  brackets) to give the information they surround special  meaning. 
* Tags are often referred to as elements. 
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes  the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes  the end. 
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more  about the content of that element. 
* Attributes require a name and a value. 
* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are  available for you to use, what they do, and where they  can go.

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.

With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

* A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
* Computers approach tasks in a different way than
 humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.
 * To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
