#### What is Java?
Java is a high-level, general-purpose, object-oriented, and secure programming language developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, Inc. in 1991. It is formally known as OAK. In 1995, Sun Microsystem changed the name to Java. In 2009, Sun Microsystem takeover by Oracle Corporation.

Editions of Java
Each edition of Java has different capabilities. There are three editions of Java:

Java Standard Editions (JSE): It is used to create programs for a desktop computer.
Java Enterprise Edition (JEE): It is used to create large programs that run on the server and manages heavy traffic and complex transactions.
Java Micro Edition (JME): It is used to develop applications for small devices such as set-top boxes, phone, and appliances.
##### loops and decisions
A normal program is not a sequential execution of expressions or statements one after the other. It will have certain conditions to be checked or it will have certain number of iterations. When we check for certain conditions to execute further then it called as decision statements. If the condition in decision statements are true then one set of instructions are executed, if false then another set of instructions are executed. This kind of decision is cannot be done using conditional operator. That will be mainly used to return single line of action / result. When we have to perform series of operation, we use IF conditions.

When we have to execute particular set of instructions multiple times or known number of times (iterations), then we use FOR loops or DO/WHILE loops.
