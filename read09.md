JavaScript Events
In this tutorial you will learn how to handle events in JavaScript.

Understanding Events and Event Handlers
An event is something that happens when user interact with the web page, such as when he clicked a link or button, entered text into an input box or textarea, made selection in a select box, pressed key on the keyboard, moved the mouse pointer, submits a form, etc. In some cases, the Browser itself can trigger the events, such as the page load and unload events.

When an event occur, you can use a JavaScript event handler (or an event listener) to detect them and perform specific task or set of tasks. By convention, the names for event handlers always begin with the word "on", so an event handler for the click event is called onclick, similarly an event handler for the load event is called onload, event handler for the blur event is called onblur, and so on.

There are several ways to assign an event handler. The simplest way is to add them directly to the start tag of the HTML elements using the special event-handler attributes.
